        | "This is our third visit to Carillon and second stay at Summer Breeze!
        | It is such a wonderful beach home.
        | The location is the BEST...right across from the pool and steps away from the beach walkover!
        | I can't say enough about how clean it is!
        | Also it is so well equipped for cooking in and cooking outside!
        | The whole Carillon environment is such a pleasure and provides such a wonderful vacation for my family!
        | Thanks again for sharing your wonderful home!"
