    <p> "This is our third visit to Carillon and second stay at Summer Breeze!
      It is such a wonderful beach home.
      The location is the BEST...right across from the pool and steps away from the beach walkover!
      I can't say enough about how clean it is!
      Also, it is so well equipped for cooking in and cooking outside!
      The whole Carillon environment is such a pleasure and provides such a wonderful vacation for my family!
      Thanks again for sharing your wonderful home!"
